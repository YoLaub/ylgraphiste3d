Generously filled with egg, ham, and melted cheese, it can be enjoyed at any time for a Breton escape full of character.<br><br>Quiche Lorraine – originating from the Lorraine region in France, this classic recipe of French cuisine combines a tender shortcrust pastry with a creamy filling of fresh cream, eggs, and smoked bacon. Best enjoyed hot or warm, served with a crisp salad for a simple, tasty, and elegant break.",
